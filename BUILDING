Prerequisites
-------------

To build libseawolf should require only a modern POSIX compliant system and GNU
Make. If you wish to also build the Seawolf hub (which you likely do) you will
also need Sqlite3 installed.



Building
--------

Under Linux to build and install under /usr/local,

  make && make install

Under FreeBSD or OpenBSD with gmake installed,

  gmake && gmake install

To install to a different prefix set the PREFIX environment variable when
running make install, e.g.,

  PREFIX=/usr make install



Cross Compiling
---------------

Support for building the library component for Blackfin systems running uCLinux
is included in this standard distribution. The Blackfin toolchain must be
present in the system path. To build run,

  CONFIG=build/config.bfin.mk make install

The library and includes will be installed into a top level folder called
'bfin'. This can be changed in the same way as the prefix for standard builds.

To crosscompile for other platforms the Blackfin configuration can be used as a
starting point. The library component of libseawolf should be able to build on
any platform with a complete POSIX environment.



Building Documentation
----------------------

To build the HTML documentation for libseawolf requires the Doxygen,
imagemagick, and graphviz packages. If these packages are installed then the
documentation can be built by issuing,

  make doc

from the top level directory. If this process completes without error (a few
warnings are to be expected) then the documentation can be found in the
doc/html/ directory. If you are unable to build the documentation then a recent
copy should be available online at http://docs.ncusrobotics.com.
